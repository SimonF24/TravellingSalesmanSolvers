# Travelling Salesman Solvers
A collection of simple implementations of algorithms solving the travelling salesman problem.

We consider the travelling salesman problem in 2D for simplicity, the extension to 3D is trivial.

Algorithms Implemented:
- Exact
  - Brute Force
- Approximate
  - Simulated Annealing
  - Genetic
  - Tabu Search
